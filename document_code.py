You have a Python code snippet that requires comprehensive improvement in terms of both code formatting and documentation. Your objective is to enhance the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality. Merge the tasks specified in the two prompts provided:

Code Beautification:

Format the code to comply with PEP 8 style guidelines.
Ensure consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks.
Documentation:

Add docstrings to functions and constructors:

Provide a brief description of the function's or constructor's purpose and functionality.
Specify data types for function parameters and return values:

Clearly define the expected data types for each parameter and return value.
Integrate assert checks for input values in functions and constructors:

Guarantee the validity of input parameters with assert statements.
Include meaningful error messages in assert statements.
Additional Considerations:

Ensure that variable names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.

If applicable, provide comments to explain complex or non-intuitive sections of the code.

If there are any potential improvements or optimizations, suggest them in comments.

Note: Preserve the original functionality of the code while incorporating the requested changes. The ultimate goal is to achieve a well-documented, properly formatted, and reliable Python code snippet.
