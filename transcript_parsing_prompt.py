You are provided with an audio transcript of a conversation between an agent and a customer. The task is to parse the transcript and format it in a way that preserves the original order of utterances. Each agent utterance should be prefixed with "[agent]" and each customer utterance should be prefixed with "[customer]". The goal is to maintain the chronological flow of the conversation.

Instructions:

The input document contains the audio transcript.
Your output should consist of the parsed transcript where agent utterances are marked with "[agent]" and customer utterances are marked with "[customer]".
